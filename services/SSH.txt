1. Port no-22
2. Configuration file- /etc/ssh/sshd_config


STEP 1:- login through with password

[root@server~] ssh root@172.50.0.1 >> yes >> password generate
			
	<<ssh root@192.50.0.10 / ssh root@192.50.0.20>> ----> now we can securely login into the server<--->client




STEP 2:- login through privatekey, without password

[root@server~] ssh-keygen - - - - Press till key generation in encrypted formate....
[root@server~] ls .ssh
[root@server .ssh] id_rsa id_rsa.pub known_host...(known_host shows login history)


[root@server~] ssh-copy-id root@<IP of ssh user>  ------->  ssh-copy-id root@172.50.0.20 
                                                        
[root@client~] ls .ssh                                   .....................................after this copy command client side key will send it & renamed and authorized it AUTOMATICALLY.
[root@client~] authorized_keys know_host 
	|
	|	   PasswordAuthentication yes = don't asked password while privatekey time login
	|        PasswordAuthentication  no  = asked password while privatekey time login
	v
[root@client~]
																

													
Now, we can succsesfully login to client's system...............

########### While using secure copy command... #################

https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-scp-command-to-securely-transfer-files/

Same region scp:- Receiver .pem key + private ip of receiver
Diffrent region:- Receiver .pem key + Public-IP

While creating instacnce we create a key-pair then..we receiver private key name called "root.pem" & public key was copy sent and stored into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys this is a public key was handled and stored by AWS Backend management.

	1. root.pem -->Private key
	2. authorized_keys --> Public Key
	
########### Master and Slave Concept... #################
	
	1. In hosts File mention private ip when all nodes are in same reion
	2. In hosts File mention public ip when all nodes are in diffrent reion
	
############# While getting clone from remote repository #################

	1. Firstly, we have to delete unwanted keys from remote repository SSH & GPG Keys section.
 	2. Do ssh-keygen in your terminal.
 	3. copy and paste the id_rsa.pub (public key) in remote repository section and save it.
 	4. Now, take clone of that remote repository via "ssh". 
 
 	# git clone <ssh.link from remote repo>
